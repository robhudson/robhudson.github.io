Some ideas on improving the site that I may or may not implement in the
future:

* Fill in the "about me" page
* Flesh out the home page with fuller content
* Add personal logo
* Deploy to github pages
  * Change `_site` to `docs`?
* Consider github comments on posts
* Add links to github, linkedin, twitter, etc in footer
* Make responsive for small screens
